<h1>Introduction</h1>

In this project, we explore various Natural Language Processing (NLP) conceptsfor identifying cognates across multiple languages. Cognates are defined as wordsthat share a common language ancestor. In this paper, we will discuss our findingsand the approach we took to create a model that accurately identifies cognates

<h1>Goal</h1>

Our aim in this project was to explore various methods of identifying cognatesand synthesize our findings to create a model that would perform well and produceaccurate results. A classifier that identifies cognates accurately can become a part ofa larger epistemology model. Such a model can help us in identifying how languageschanged over the millenniums. It can also help us in finding the origin of words andpreserving endangered languages.

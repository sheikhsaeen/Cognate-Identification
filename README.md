<h1>Introduction</h1>

In this project, we explore various Natural Language Processing (NLP) concepts for identifying cognates across multiple languages. Cognates are defined as words that share a common language ancestor. In this paper, we will discuss our findings and the approach we took to create a model that accurately identifies cognates

<h1>Goal</h1>

Our aim in this project was to explore various methods of identifying cognates and synthesize our findings to create a model that would perform well and produce accurate results. A classifier that identifies cognates accurately can become a part of a larger epistemology model. Such a model can help us in identifying how languages changed over the millenniums. It can also help us in finding the origin of words and preserving endangered languages.
